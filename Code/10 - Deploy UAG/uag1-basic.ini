# In this example, the vCenter username is administrator@vsphere.local

# vSphere Network names. For pre 3.3 UAG versions, a vSphere Network Protocol Profile (NPP) must be associated with every referenced network name. This specifies
# network settings such as IPv4 subnet mask, gateway etc. UAG 3.3 and newer no longer uses NPPs and so for static IPv4 addresses a netmask0, netmask1 and netmask2
# value must be specified for each NIC. Normally a defaultGateway setting is also required.

# Setting honorCipherOrder to true forces the TLS cipher order to be the order specified by the server. This can be set on
# UAG 2.7.2 and newer to force the Forward Secrecy ciphers to be presented first to improve security.
